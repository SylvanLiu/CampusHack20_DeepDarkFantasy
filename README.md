## Everything of this project has been finished in 12 hours by one friend of mine, Yuzhe Yang, and me in the 2020 Hackathon of our university.

### Include:
### 1. a snippet of MatLab codes for mobile devices that can cost a fraction of the resource to recognise the user's motion in real-time.
### 2. a homemade dataset of human actions recorded by us, including walking, running, sitting, standing and dancing.
### 3. a .mat file that contains the weights of our model, a pre-trained gated bag of decision trees, which is used for making the prediction.
### 4. slides for introduction and presentation.
