## Everything of this project has been finished in 12 hours by one friend of mine, Yuzhe Yang, and me in the 2020 Hackathon of our university.

#### DeepDarkFantasy was our team name. xD

### Include:
#### 1. a snippet of MatLab codes for mobile devices that can cost a fraction of the resource to recognise the user's motion in real-time.
#### 2. a homemade dataset of human actions recorded by us, including walking, running, sitting, standing and dancing, has been devided into a validation set and a training set.
#### 3. a .mat file that contains the weights of our model, a pre-trained gated bag of decision trees, which is used for making the prediction.
#### 4. slides for introduction and presentation.

We found the features from the magnetic sensors are the most salient one, and the accuracy of our model is not bad, could be 92.7%.
