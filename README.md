# CampusHack20_DeepDarkFantasy
Everthing of this project was made in 12 hours by me and one friends of mine in the 2020 Hackathon of our university.
Include:
1. a small matlab program for mobile devices that can cost a fraction of the resource to recognise user's motion in real time.
2. a homemade dataset of human motions recorded by us.
2. a pre-trained gated bag of decision trees model which is used for makeing prediction.
3. slides for presentation.
